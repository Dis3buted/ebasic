<h1>Epiphany BASIC documentation</h1>
eBASIC is entirely case insensitive, line numbers can be provided but are optional. By default the user code, symbol table and program data are all allocated in core local memory, although this can be selected via language mechanisms and command line arguments.

<h2>Assignment</h2>
Normal variable assignment follows the form <i>identifier=expression</i> or <i>let identifier=expression</i>, both are which are handled the same. eBASIC supports integers, real numbers (single precision) and strings to be stored in variables. The type of a variable depends upon the current value being stored within it and if the variable does not currently exist then it will be created.
<pre>
a="hello"
b="world"
c=a+" "+b
print c
</pre>
<pre>
a=12
b=2.3
print a
a=a+b
print b
</pre>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
The language supports arrays of integers and reals via the <i>dim</i> and <i>sdim</i> statements. The first will allocate the array into the default location (which will be core memory unless overridden by command line arguments) and the second, <i>sdim</i>, will allocate into shared memory which is larger but slower to access.
<pre>
dim a[100]
for i=0 to 99
a[i]=i
next
</pre>
<i>Note: All arrays can be forced into shared memory via supplying -datashared as a command line argument</i>

<h2>Parallelism</h2>
eBASIC will run the code on each core, with each core being independant and having separate values of all data. Cores can communicate via some inbuilt language mechanisms. By default all cores on the Epiphany chip will execute the user code, but this can be selected via the <i>-c</i> command line switch; for instance <i>-c 1</i> will run on core 1 only, <i>-c 1,2,3,4</i> will run on cores 1,2,3 and 4, <i>-c 5:10</i> will run on cores 5 to 10 inclusive and <i>-c all</i> will run on all cores.
<h3>coreid</h3>
This expression determines the numeric (integer) id of a core in the Epiphany chip. This value can be used to select sections of code to be executed by a subset of the cores (SPMD style) and the integer value can be used in mathematic expressions like any other integer.
<pre>
print "Hello world from core "+coreid
</pre>
<pre>
if coreid=0 then
print "Hello only from core "+coreid
end if
</pre>

<h3>Point to point communication</h3>
eBASIC implements P2P communications between specific cores via the <i>send</i> and <i>recv</i> keywords. The send keyword follows the syntax <i>send expression to integer</i> where <i>expression</i> is any mathematical expression (including varables and arrays) that hold integers or reals. The <i>integer</i> represents the core id of the target core. The recv keyword follows the syntax <i>recv identifier from integer</i> where <i>identifier</i> is a variable or array access to a variable, and <i>integer</i> is the source core to receive from. Note that it is only possible to communicate single integers or reals, there is no communication of strings or arrays.
<pre>
if coreid=0 then
  send 20 to 1
else if coreid = 1 then
  recv a from 0
  print "Got value "+a+" from core 0"
end if
end if
</pre>

<h3>Collective communication</h3>
Two forms of collective communication are supported; broadcasting data and reducing data. The broadcast follows the syntax <i>bcast expression from integer into identifier</i> which will broadcast an expression (a variable, maths expression etc) from the root core with id of <i>integer</i> supplied and each core will store this in <i>identifier</i> which will be created if it does not exist and this includes the root core. Note that it is only possible to communicate single integers or reals, there is no communication of strings or arrays.
<pre>
bcast random % 100 from 0 into a
print "The random number from core 0 is "+a
</pre>
A reduction follows the syntax <i>reduce operator expression into identifier</i> where operator is one of <i>sum</i>, <i>prod</i>, <i>min</i> or <i>max</i>, the <i>expression</i> (which is often different on different cores) on each core is combined, the operator applied and the result available in <i>identifier</i> on each core.
<pre>
reduce max random % 100 into a
print "The highest random number is "+a
</pre>

<h3>Synchronisation</h3>
All the active cores can be synchronised via the <i>sync</i> keyword, where they will all wait at this barrier until every other core has reached a corresponding <i>sync</i> call
<pre>
print "Hello from core "+coreid
sync
print "After sync from core "+coreid
</pre>

<h2>Control flow</h2>
<h3>Conditional</h3>
eBASIC implements conditionals via the <i>if</i> statement, <i>if expression then then-block end if</i> or <i>if expression then then-block else else-block end if</i> or <i>if expression then statement</i>. The later is constrained to a single statement (on the same line) whereas the other two can have any number of statements, including other conditionals in their <i>then-block</I> or <i>else-block</i>. The <i>expression</i> should be a logical expression and eBASIC supports, = (equality test), != (not equals), < (smaller than), <= (smaller or equals), > (greater than) and >= (greater or equals.) It is also possible to and expressions together via <i>and</i>, you can also or expressions via <i>or</i>. Note the only operator supported for strings is equality testing. It is possible to combine integers and reals when testing, in such cases integers are tested as floats.
<pre>
if coreid=0 or coreid=1 then
print "Core id is 0 or 1"
else
print "Core id is not 0 or 1"
end if
</pre>
<h3>Loops</h3>
Loops are implemented via the <i>for</i> keyword, <i>for identifier=expression1 to expression2 block next</i> . Where identifier is the variable holding the integer index (it is created if does not already exist) and set to be the result of <i>expression1</i> initially. On each iteration it is incremented by 1 and will continue to loop until it passes the integer value of <i>expression2</i> .
<pre>
for i=1 to 10
print "iteration "+i
next
</pre>
<h3>Goto</h3>
Optionally lines can be given a line number (provided at the start of the line) and the <i>goto</i> statement can be used to set control flow to that line.
<pre>
a=0
10 a=a+1
print a
if a < 10 then goto 10
</pre>

<h2>Maths</h2>
Maths functions work with both integer and real numbers and variables. There are a number of inbuilt operators for sum (+), minus (-), multiplication (/), divide (*), modulo (%) and power (^ or **). A number of keywords are built into the language that provide other maths functionality.

<h2>IO</h2>
eBASIC provides the <i>print</i> and <i>input</i> statements. These work with integers, reals and strings.
<pre>
input "Enter your name: ", a
print "Hello "+a
</pre>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
There are three ways of commenting code. Using traditional BASIC syntax, <i>REM</i> can be prefixed at the start of a line to denotes that it is a comment and to be ignored. Both C (<i> /* .... */</i>) spanning multiple lines and C++ (<i>//</i>) comments are also supported.
<h3>Stop</h3>
Terminates execution
<pre>
10 a=random % 100
print a
if a < 50 then stop
goto 10
</pre>

<h2>Command line arguments</h2>
You must provide the filename of the user program (or <i>-l bytecodefile</i> if loading from byte code.) eBASIC provides a number of command line arguments to manage aspects such as the placement of data, actives cores etc..
<table rows=3 border=1>
<tr><td>Switch</td><td>Arguments</td><td>Explanation</td></tr>
<tr><td>-s</td><td></td><td>Displays memory usage statistics of the BASIC code</td></tr>
<tr><td>-t</td><td></td><td>Displays running time for each core</td></tr>
<tr><td>-datashared</td><td></td><td>Forces all data to be placed within shared memory (512 Kb shared memory allocated for each core.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-corecode</td><td></td><td>Forces the byte representation of the BASIC program to be copied onto each core, this is the default choice</td></tr>
<tr><td>-coreshared</td><td></td><td>Forces the byte representation of the BASIC program to be copied into shared memory, this impacts performance</td></tr>
<tr><td>-o</td>filename<td></td><td>Writes the byte format of the BASIC program to file, does not run the program</td></tr>
<tr><td>-l</td>filename<td></td><td>Loads the byte format of a code from file and runs it</td></tr>
<tr><td>-h</td><td></td><td>Display help message</td></tr>
<tr><td>-c</td>a a,b,c a:c all<td></td><td>Core selection; single core (a), list of cores (a,b,c), range (a:c) or all (all)</td></tr>
